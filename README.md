## Acknowledgements

The image translation network used in this project was the wonderful [pix2pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix). Thanks Phillipi! 

Thanks, also, to Steve Purves for building the Earth models provided (in .zip format) in [dat/zips](./dat/zips)! To use these models simply `cd dat/zips/` and `unzip xxx`, where `xxx` is the file name.
